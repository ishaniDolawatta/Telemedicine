# Telemedicine


# Context and goal

Telemedicine is a cloud-based solution using AWS services enabled mobile application which allows users to connect with a physician. Using natural language processing patients will be connected to the most relevant physician. 

The mobile app will enable vocal communication with the patient and physician.

The physicianâ€™s vocal instructions will be analyzed and converted to the text.

The resulting text will be used to extract medical information such as medical conditions, medications, dosages, tests, treatments, and procedures.

Extracted medical information is used to present meaningful prescriptions as a result.
